# Dependencies are expressed as make rules without action of the form:
#   <TARGET>: <PREREQUISITE1> <PREREQUISITE2> ... <PREREQUISITEN>
# indicating that <TARGET> can be processed only after <PREREQUISITE1>
# <PREREQUISITE2> ... <PREREQUISITEN>.
#
# Targets and prerequisites can have one of three forms:
#   X
# if X.vhd is a source file in the current module, or:
#   A_LIB.X
# if ../A/X.vhd is a source file in module A (source directory ../A) or:
#   EXTERN.X
# if X is an external VHDL library. Each external VHDL library found in a
# dependencies.txt file must have a definition in $(rootdir)/externs.mk. Please
# see $(rootdir)/hwprj/externs.mk.template for an example externs.mk.
#
# .NOSYN is a special target indicating that its prerequisites are not
# synthesizable (typically simulation environments).
#
# Example: with the following declarations
#
#   .NOSYN: T
#   X: Y B_LIB.Z EXTERN.E
#   T: EXTERN.E X
#
# - T.vhd, X.vhd and Y.vhd are source files of the curent module.
# - Z.vhd is a source files of module B which source directory is ../B.
# - T.vhd is not synthesizable.
# - Y.vhd and ../B/Z.vhd must be processed before X.vhd.
# - X.vhd and T.vhd can be processed only if the external library E exists and
#   is properly declared in $(rootdir)/externs.mk.
# - X.vhd must be processed before T.vhd.
#
# Only direct dependencies must be expressed. Indirect dependencies are
# automatically computed. In the preceeding example the indirect dependency:
#   T: Y
# is computed from the others.
